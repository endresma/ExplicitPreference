# ExplicitPreference
Source code for the implementation of LSE described in the paper "Beyond Skylines: Explicit Preferences".

* M. Endres, T. Preisinger: Beyond Skylines: Explicit Preferences

DataGenerator contains files to generate input data for the algorithms.
ExplicitLS contains the LSE algorithm as well as BNL. 
BTG represents the lattice structure
LatticeEmbedding is used to embedd any general strict partial order into a lattice
