# ExplicitPreference
Source code for the implementation of LSE described in the paper "M. Endres, T. Preisinger: Beyond Skylines: Explicit Preferences"

* ExplicitLS contains the LSE algorithm as well as BNL. 
* LatticeEmbedding is used to embedd any general strict partial order into a lattice
* DataGenerator contains files to generate input data for the algorithms.
* BTG represents the lattice structure

Note that this source code also needs the JGraphT library which can be found at http://jgrapht.org
